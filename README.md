# Mammal-Population-Density
This project will analyze the mammal population density in four different U.S. national parks to understand which park would be the best choice to observe mammals. 

## Introduction 

### Problem 
Animal observation in their natural habitat isn't an easy task, and choosing the right place to go is a key factor for success. But the United States has over 60 national parks, given that some of then have over 52,000 kmÂ², choosing the right place to observe animals can become a fatiguing process.

### Project Goal 
In order to provide some lite on the process of choosing the right place to observe animals, the present project aims to analyze which of four given U.S. National Parks an individual can have the highest probability of observing mammals in their natural habitat.

### Data 
The project data consistis in the following:
- ```species_info.csv``` - contains data about different species and their conservation status;
- ```observations.csv````- holds recorded sightings of different species at several national parks for the past 7 days;
- ```park_area.csv``` - has the total area of the national parks.
